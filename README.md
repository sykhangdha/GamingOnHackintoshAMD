Guide + Testing of games on a AMD Hackintosh (RX580 | Ryzen 5 3600)
A guide will be released later on how I was able to get the games pictured below running and testing playability
Note: For users with a stronger GPU that supports Metal 3 games will run MUCH better using D3DMetal feature in CrossOver(With moltenVK CXPatcher)

# W.I.P(Currently tested games so far)

# Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition

Status: Works(Mostly with one major bug) | Playable, but when playing with my original screen resolution(1920x1080) caused the textures to be blurry no matter what. Lowering the resolution fixed it and you must set the 3D settings in the game lower. 

# Palworld

Status: Works | Loading into the game takes a VERY long time intially. The game will freeze when creating a world for a bit as textures load and when the world loads in as well. After the game runs fine with low/medium settings. So far no major texture issues.
